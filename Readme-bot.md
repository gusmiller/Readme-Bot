## Readme-Bot Generator

We introuce ourselves, when we get a new job, or at school, at the soccer team. We all do, and we do it in an elloquent way -most of the times, because we are proud of who we are and what we have achieved in life and our experience. We want all to know who we are, what we know, and what we bring to the group. It is a normal and regular thing to do. Well, think of a Readme file as a way of introducing you application, what was the idea behind, how it does it and how can all use it.

In other words a Readme file should be described as a documentation with guidelines, instructions and parameters on how to use our project. It should contain different sections, each with instructions, steps, command and imagea on how to install and run the project.

In other words, a Readme.md file is an escential as part of any project. 

As developer's we need to know how to write a README because:

    - It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
    - It will make your project standout from a bunch of others. Also be sure your project is good too.
    - It will help you focus on what your project needs to deliver and how.

Here is my product!
