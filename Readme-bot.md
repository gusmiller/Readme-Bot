## Readme-Bot Generator

We introduce ourselves, when we get a new job, or at school, at the soccer team. We all do, and we do it in an eloquent way -most of the times, because we are proud of who we are and what we have achieved in life and our experience. We want all to know who we are, what we know, and what we bring to the group. It is a normal and regular thing to do. Well, think of a Readme file as a way of introducing you application, what was the idea behind, how it does it and how can all use it.

In other words, a Readme file should be described as a documentation with guidelines, instructions and parameters on how to use our project. It should contain different sections, each with instructions, steps, command and images on how to install and run the project.

In other words, a Readme.md file is an essential as part of any project. 

As developer's we need to know how to write a README because:

    - It is the first file a person sees when opening your project.
	- Take advantage of this and be brief but detailed.
    - It makes your project standout! 
    - Share your vision and goals with your audience.

Though, Readme files are important, they are long, tedious to write and organize -in other words a pain in the bud. This is the main focus and objective of the project; create a Node CLI application that would interact with the developer, and in the process create a Readme template with all the desire sections (even with Lorem Ipsum parragraphs). The sky is the limit, fork the project, make it your own, or collaborate with new features and enhancements. End the end this is what you get; the file you are reading.

Here is my product!

## Application Usage

The usage of the application is pretty simple. Once you launch the application, it will ask a series of questions, most questions are optional. The idea is that at the end of the questionnaire, the application will create a Readme file that contains all the sections required.

Application uses inputs and also choices that allowed us to build the body of each different section. It also allows the user to use the default editor to enter long paragraphs. All paragraphs can be created using MD markup language.

Once you have created your read me file you're free to change anything you want. Add videos or images that would help the client understand.
